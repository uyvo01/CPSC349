    <h3>1. Every styling must be done one external stylesheets. No internal stylesheet and definitely no inline styling! </h3>
    <h3>2. Your website should be responsive. This means if I resize your browser or change the
      screen device, the pages and layout should behave such that contents are still shown
      effectively maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.
    <h3>3. You must apply at least 40 unique CSS properties!</h3>
    <h3>4. You will use an on-line CSS validator to verify that your webpages are correct. Screenshots
      of the validator report for each external stylesheet are part of your submission. </h3>
    <h3>Once your pages are finished, upload them to a web server so it's live on the internet! You
      may choose any method you'd like but in class I had shown how to deploy in Netlify and
      Github pages.</h3>
    <h3>6. To complete the assignment, submit to Canvas your screenshots from the Validator, a link
      to your Github repo, and the link to your website under the Comment box in the submission
      or on a text file.</h3>
    <h3>7. Note: For this assignment, do not include any scripting on your site and do not use any
      CSS library</h3>
